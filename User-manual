For Executing this project,
 First, you have to access channel on the Thing Speak cloud server by your mail id and
password.
 You will see four fields displaying Soil Moisture value, Water Pump value, and two
widgets showing Pump Status.
 You have to place the soil moisture in Wet and Dry soil.
 When you will put the sensor in wet soil, in the Thing Speak channel, you can see soil
moisture value is increased to more than 40%, Water pump value will remain 0, the
pump status will display red color and you can see that the water pump connected with
the devices do not make the water flow through its pipe.
 But when you will put the soil moisture sensor in the dry soil, in the Thing Speak
channel, you can see soil moisture value is decreased to less than 40%, Water pump
value will increased to 1, the pump status will display green color and you can see that
the water pump connected with the devices make the water flow through its pipe.
 That is the complete working of this project, the detecƟon of soil moisture present in
soil and automatic irrigation.
